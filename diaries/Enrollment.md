Yes — your approach is **exactly right** and aligns with **best practices** for handling many-to-many relationships in real-world Spring Boot applications. Let’s break it down clearly:

## ✅ Why Use an Extra Table (`Enrollment`)?

You're modeling a relationship:

```
Person (student) ⬌ Course
       ⬍
    Enrollment
```

Instead of using:

```java
@ManyToMany
private Set<Course> courses;
```

You're using:

```java
@OneToMany(mappedBy = "student")
private List<Enrollment> enrollments;
```

This is **the preferred way** because:

| With Join Table (`Enrollment`)                             | Without |
| ---------------------------------------------------------- | ------- |
| Can store metadata (grade, status, enrolledAt) ✅           | ❌       |
| Can query/filter easily (e.g., "all active enrollments") ✅ | ❌       |
| Avoids JPA ManyToMany complexity ✅                         | ❌       |
| Better scalability and DB normalization ✅                  | ❌       |

## 🧩 Why Cascade Only on `Enrollment`

You're also correct in applying:

```java
@OneToMany(cascade = CascadeType.PERSIST)
private List<Enrollment> enrollments;
```

This means:

* When saving a `Person` or `Course`, new `Enrollment`s get persisted too.
* But you're **not deleting or merging** them blindly — this avoids data loss or accidental updates.

> ❗ **Never** cascade `REMOVE` across enrollment unless you're really sure — it might delete student or course records unintentionally.

## 🧠 Summary: Why This Is the Right Design

| Design Aspect                | Your Decision                      | Verdict          |
| ---------------------------- | ---------------------------------- | ---------------- |
| Use extra `Enrollment` table | ✅ Better control, metadata support | ✅ Best practice  |
| Cascade only PERSIST         | ✅ Avoid accidental deletes/merges  | ✅ Safe and clean |
| Avoid direct ManyToMany      | ✅ Hard to scale and customize      | ✅ Correct        |

### 💡 Bonus Tips

* In your service layer, **manage relationships via `Enrollment`**, not from `Person` or `Course`.
* For DTOs, flatten like this:

```java
EnrollmentDTO {
  Long courseId;
  String courseTitle;
  LocalDate enrolledAt;
  String status;
}
```

Let me know if you want a sample repository + service method to enroll a student into a course using this structure.
