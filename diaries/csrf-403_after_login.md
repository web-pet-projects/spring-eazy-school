You're doing everything *almost* right — and this log shows **authentication succeeded**, but **authorization failed immediately after login**, which is why you're being redirected to:

```
http://localhost:8080/error?continue
```

### 🔍 Key Log Line

```plaintext
o.s.s.w.access.AccessDeniedHandlerImpl : Responding with 403 status code
```

### 🧠 Translation:

* ✅ You **logged in successfully** as `admin`.
* 🚫 But your user was **immediately denied access (403 Forbidden)**.
* So Spring Security redirected you to the error page.

---

## 🔎 What’s Likely Causing This?

After login, Spring tries to redirect the user to the **original saved request**, or to `/` by default.

If:

* The user lands on a page they’re not authorized to view
* Or the default landing page (`/`) is protected and your config doesn’t allow it

➡️ you’ll get a 403, then a redirect to `/error`.

---

## ✅ How to Fix This

### ✅ 1. **Allow access to `/` or your homepage**

In your security config:

```java
http.authorizeHttpRequests(auth -> auth
    .requestMatchers("/", "/login", "/sign-in", "/h2-console/**", "/css/**", "/js/**").permitAll()
    .anyRequest().authenticated()
);
```

Make sure whatever page Spring redirects to **after login** is accessible.

---

### ✅ 2. **Set a custom default success URL (recommended)**

In your `SecurityFilterChain`, add:

```java
http.formLogin(form -> form
    .loginPage("/login")
    .defaultSuccessUrl("/dashboard", true) // 👈 customize this
    .permitAll()
);
```

* `"/dashboard"` should be a page that **your user roles have access to**
* The second argument `true` means **always redirect there**, regardless of saved request

---

### ✅ 3. **Optional: Add a custom access denied page**

```java
http.exceptionHandling(exception -> 
    exception
        .accessDeniedPage("/access-denied")
);
```

So you don't just get dumped into `/error`.

---

## ✅ What You Should Do Now

1. ✅ Make sure your user has access to the **page you redirect them to**
2. ✅ Add a `.defaultSuccessUrl(...)` to control where login redirects
3. ✅ Check your route permissions (e.g., `requestMatchers(...)`) and ensure `ROLE_ADMIN` is allowed

| ----------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| Logged in, then redirected to `/error?continue` | Authenticated but hit **403 Forbidden** | Set `.defaultSuccessUrl()` to a page user can access        |
| Page after login is protected                   | Role mismatch                           | Add `.hasRole("ADMIN")` or `.permitAll()` for redirect page |

Would you like me to review your full `SecurityFilterChain` setup and give you a minimal working config that includes login, roles, and a clean dashboard redirect?
