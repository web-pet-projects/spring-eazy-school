## üß† What You Observed:

> In old Spring MVC apps, they use `HttpSession` to temporarily store a domain object (like a `User`, `Message`, `Form`) after fetching it once ‚Äî and **re-use it later** instead of fetching again from DB or service.

### ‚úÖ Benefit:

* **Avoids duplicate DB calls**
* Especially useful in **multi-step forms**, **Wizards**, or **edit flows**

---

## ‚ùì Is this still considered best practice?

### ‚úÖ In some **stateful, session-backed UI apps** (like those built with Thymeleaf or JSP):

Yes, using `HttpSession` **intentionally** for temporary, user-specific state **is still acceptable**.

Typical use cases:

* Form step 1 ‚Üí step 2 ‚Üí final submit
* Edit resource ‚Üí confirmation ‚Üí submit
* Preserving validation errors

### ‚ùå In **modern stateless REST APIs or microservices**:

**No. Avoid storing business objects in session.**

Why?

| Reason                 | Explanation                                                      |
| ---------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| ‚ùå Breaks statelessness | Each API call should be independent (REST principle)             |
| ‚ùå Memory risk          | Each user session holds large objects = memory bloat             |
| ‚ùå Harder to scale      | Load balancing and clustering are harder with stateful servers   |
| ‚ùå Security risk        | Session data can be tampered or exposed without care             |
| ‚ùå Debugging complexity | You now rely on invisible state instead of explicit request data |

---

## ‚úÖ What‚Äôs preferred today?

In modern backend design:

* Use **stateless** controllers and services
* Always pass necessary data explicitly (via ID, DTO, JWT, etc.)
* Use **short-lived tokens, Redis, or frontend caching** instead of server-side sessions

## üîç Real-world Rule of Thumb

| Context                                   | Use HttpSession?                                  |
| ----------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| Multi-step Thymeleaf form                 | ‚úÖ yes, it‚Äôs convenient                            |
| Admin panel workflow (1 user, small data) | ‚úÖ acceptable                                      |
| REST API                                  | ‚ùå never                                           |
| Microservices                             | ‚ùå never                                           |
| Auth/session management                   | ‚úÖ with Spring Security (but only store auth info) |

---

## ‚úÖ TL;DR Summary

* `HttpSession`-based caching **is clever** ‚Äî but best used **only in session-based web apps**
* **Don't use it in APIs or microservices**
* Prefer stateless calls, frontend caching, or backend cache (Redis) if optimization is needed

Would you like a quick example of replacing a `HttpSession`-based flow with a modern stateless REST pattern (e.g. by passing a `resourceId` in the request)?
