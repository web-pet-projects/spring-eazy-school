You're getting this error from H2:

```
Syntax error in SQL statement [...] expected "identifier"
```

And the specific culprit is:

```
a1_0.[*]primary
```

This points to the `primary` column in your `addresses` table.

---

## ❌ Root Cause

### `primary` is a **reserved SQL keyword** (in H2 and most databases).

So when Spring (or Hibernate) generates SQL like:

```sql
SELECT a1_0.primary FROM addresses a1_0
```

…it causes a syntax error unless properly escaped.

---

## ✅ Solution Options

### ✅ Option 1: Rename the field

**Recommended** — rename the field in your entity and DB schema to avoid reserved words:

```java
@Column(name = "is_primary")
private boolean primary;
```

Or better:

```java
@Column(name = "is_primary")
private boolean isPrimary;
```

Then in your table:

```sql
ALTER TABLE addresses RENAME COLUMN primary TO is_primary;
```

✅ Cleaner, avoids escaping, works across databases.

---

### ✅ Option 2: Escape the column name (if you must keep `primary`)

In your entity:

```java
@Column(name = "`primary`") // Backticks for H2/MySQL
private boolean primary;
```

⚠️ But:

* **PostgreSQL** uses double quotes: `"primary"`
* **H2** supports backticks, but this breaks portability

So only do this if renaming is not an option.

## ✅ Summary

| Problem                            | Fix                                                    |
| ---------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| `primary` is a reserved SQL word   | Rename it (e.g. `is_primary`) or escape with backticks |
| H2 can't parse `primary` unescaped | Use `@Column(name = "`primary`")`                      |
| Best practice                      | Avoid reserved words as column names altogether        |

Would you like me to help audit your `Address` entity for other risky column names (like `state`, `role`, `group`, etc.) and suggest safe replacements?
